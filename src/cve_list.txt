CVE	Published	Last Update	Max CVSS Base Score	EPSS Score	CISA KEV Added	Public Exploit Exists	Summary
CVE-2024-52940	2024-11-18	2024-11-18	7.5	10.09%		Potential	AnyDesk through 8.1.0 on Windows, when Allow Direct Connections is enabled, inadvertently exposes a public IP address within network traffic. The attacker must know the victim's AnyDesk ID.
CVE-2024-12754	2024-12-30	2024-12-30	5.5	4.73%			AnyDesk Link Following Information Disclosure Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows local attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of AnyDesk. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of background images. By creating a junction, an attacker can abuse the service to read arbitrary files. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to disclose stored credentials, leading to further compromise. Was ZDI-CAN-23940.
CVE-2023-26509	2023-07-03	2023-07-11	7.5	0.22%			AnyDesk 7.0.8 allows remote Denial of Service.
CVE-2022-32450	2022-07-18	2022-07-22	7.1	0.04%		Potential	AnyDesk 7.0.9 allows a local user to gain SYSTEM privileges via a symbolic link because the user can write to their own %APPDATA% folder (used for ad.trace and chat) but the product runs as SYSTEM when writing chat-room data there.
CVE-2021-44426	2022-09-12	2022-09-16	8.8	0.25%		Potential	An issue was discovered in AnyDesk before 6.2.6 and 6.3.x before 6.3.5. An upload of an arbitrary file to a victim's local ~/Downloads/ directory is possible if the victim is using the AnyDesk Windows client to connect to a remote machine, if an attacker is also connected remotely with AnyDesk to the same remote machine. The upload is done without any approval or action taken by the victim.
CVE-2021-44425	2022-09-12	2022-09-16	6.5	0.11%		Potential	An issue was discovered in AnyDesk before 6.2.6 and 6.3.x before 6.3.3. An unnecessarily open listening port on a machine in the LAN of an attacker, opened by the Anydesk Windows client when using the tunneling feature, allows the attacker unauthorized access to the local machine's AnyDesk tunneling protocol stack (and also to any remote destination machine software that is listening to the AnyDesk tunneled port).
CVE-2021-40854	2021-10-14	2021-10-20	7.8	0.12%			AnyDesk before 6.2.6 and 6.3.x before 6.3.3 allows a local user to obtain administrator privileges by using the Open Chat Log feature to launch a privileged Notepad process that can launch other applications.
CVE-2020-35483	2021-01-11	2021-01-20	7.8	0.05%			AnyDesk before 6.1.0 on Windows, when run in portable mode on a system where the attacker has write access to the application directory, allows this attacker to compromise a local user account via a read-only setting for a Trojan horse gcapi.dll file.
CVE-2020-27614	2020-12-09	2021-07-21	7.8	0.03%			AnyDesk for macOS versions 6.0.2 and older have a vulnerability in the XPC interface that does not properly validate client requests and allows local privilege escalation.
CVE-2020-13160	2020-06-09	2021-03-15	9.8	77.30%		Public	AnyDesk before 5.5.3 on Linux and FreeBSD has a format string vulnerability that can be exploited for remote code execution.
CVE-2018-13102	2018-07-03	2018-09-11	7.8	0.26%			AnyDesk before "12.06.2018 - 4.1.3" on Windows 7 SP1 has a DLL preloading vulnerability.
CVE-2017-14397	2017-09-12	2017-09-19	9.8	0.49%			AnyDesk before 3.6.1 on Windows has a DLL injection vulnerability.
